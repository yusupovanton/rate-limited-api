## Mockery Integration

### Overview

Mockery is a tool used in Go projects to generate mocks for interfaces. This is particularly useful in unit testing, where you want to test components in isolation without relying on their concrete implementations. By generating mocks for interfaces, you can simulate the behavior of dependencies, making it easier to test the interaction between components.

### Easy installation guide
You can install mockery using make tools command and re-generate the files yourself :)

### How It Works with the Handler Package

In the provided handler package example, the `//go:generate ../../../bin/mockery --name rateLimiter` comment indicates the use of Mockery to generate a mock for the `rateLimiter` interface. This mock can then be used in tests to control the behavior of the rate limiter, such as allowing or denying requests based on the IP address, without needing to interact with the real rate limiting system.

### Benefits

- **Isolation:** Enables testing of the `Handler` component in isolation from external dependencies like rate limiting services.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for testing various scenarios, including edge cases that might be difficult to replicate with real implementations.
- **Simplicity:** Simplifies the setup for unit tests by removing the need to configure and manage actual dependencies.

### Generating Mocks

To generate mocks using Mockery, navigate to the directory containing the interface you wish to mock and run the `go generate` command. Ensure that Mockery is installed and accessible in your path. The specific command in the example, `//go:generate ../../../bin/mockery --name rateLimiter`, specifies the path to the Mockery binary and the name of the interface to mock.
